                    <p>A person who is not only a friend but becomes your habit. With whom you can feel the energy just
                        by being around. And most importantly a friend who can never leave you for someone else, who
                        always prays for your success, and who is always there for you.</p>
                    <p>A friend with all these superiorities is irreplaceable. You have to be very lucky to have such a
                        friend. And I have one. Thanks for being this irreplaceable friend Maheen. (No thanks)</p>

                    <p>Whatever I write in this I had never spoke to you and more than I feel about you.
                        How important you are to me I had never told you because I don‚Äôt want to show that.
                        Start with our first meet way in math lecture in tution.
                        When I saw you first in math lecture I thought you have so much attitude but you proved me
                        wrong.
                        You were always in your phone in fre time, that is why I was thinking you are rude and have
                        attitude.
                        But then I realized what I thought about you is Completely wrong.
                        You have Very Friendly Nature Which is so nice
                        Time by Time Slowly we became best friends
                        I Thanked To math for you met me.
                        Quality of time I spent with you is memorable.
                        You know you are short and I joke of for it.
                        I want you to know that I need you in my life in every or any situation.
                        Every short girl needs tall best friend and I mean it.
                        It is different thing that I don‚Äôt know how to pose with you but also you can give good pose
                        with others except me.
                        I hope that our friendship remains same after marriage.
                        I share my all secrets with you without any fear.
                        There are lots of people to convincing me but you are the only one person who understands me
                        best.
                        We have less photos and more memories
                        Have friends less but best and you are great.
                        I love you my shorty.

                        and I didn't know that within a short time we became friends like sisters.....‚ù§Ô∏è.with her we not

                        me her problem and tantions Doesn't matter she alon able to handle every situation but meaning
                        of actual frend not completed in this situation.
